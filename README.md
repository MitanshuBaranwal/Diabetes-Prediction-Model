## Description  
diabetes.csv in a csv file is taken for training and testing purpose. Data preprocessing is done on the available diabetes data which is suitable for training the model. After Data preprocessing, a Support Vector model is built. The dataset is split into testing and training sets. The training data is used to train the model then the new data/ testing data is given to the trained Support Vector Machine model for prediction.


## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x.
- Required Libraries: numpy, matplotlib, pandas, seaborn, sklearn

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/MitanshuBaranwal/Diabetes-Prediction-Model.git
    cd Diabetes-Prediction-Model/

## ModelBuilding 

Open file "code" and run the file it will save the model DiabetesPredictionModel.pkl file. 

You can do the prediction for custom data sets of yours in code script by providing the data set that you want to predict
